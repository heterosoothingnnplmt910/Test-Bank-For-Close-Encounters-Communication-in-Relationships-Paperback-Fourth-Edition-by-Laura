   * Taking a relational approach to the study of interpersonal communication, Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships, Fourth Edition, by Laura K. Guerrero, Peter A. Andersen, and Walid A. Afifi, helps students better understand their relationships with romantic partners, friends, and family members. The authors offer research-based insights and content illustrated with engaging scenarios to show how state-of-the-art research and theory can be applied to specific issues within relationships―with a focus on issues that are central to describing and understanding close relationships. While maintaining the spotlight on communication, the authors also emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the study of personal relationships by including research from such disciplines as social psychology and family studies.
